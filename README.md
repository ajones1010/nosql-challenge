Module 12 Challenge

This is my analysis for the Module 12 homework analyzing data from the UK Food Standards Agency regarding their food hygiene rating. The purpose of this assignment is to act as if I was contracted by the editors of a food magazine, "Eat Safe, Love", to evaluate ratings data in order to help their journalists and critics decide where to focus future articles.
